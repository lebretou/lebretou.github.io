        <p>
            Welcome! Thank you again for participating in our study. On this page, we present instructions on how to
            complete the trials. Please carefully read the following instructions as your performance is dependent on
            understanding the task.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Our study involves three parts: “visual”, “tactile”, and “tabular”.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The “visual” part of the study will involve you inspecting some simple geometric shapes on a computer
                display. This condition has 42 trials. You will first identify the smaller visual encoding. Then, in a
                number between 0 and 100, you will estimate what the proportion of the smaller encoding is to the larger
                one.
            </li>
            <li>
                The “tactile” part will involve inspecting some geometric shapes on embossed paper by touching the
                paper with your hands and answering questions. You will be <b style="color: red;">blindfolded</b> with a
                piece of cloth for this
                part of the study. This condition has 42 trials. You will first locate the tactile pair on the embossed
                paper. Then, same to the "visual" condition, you will answer orally to the study administrator which one
                is the smaller encoding. Finally, you will answer to the study administrator a number between 0 and 100
                of what the proportion of the smaller encoding is to the larger one.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, the “tabular” part will involve viewing a data table on a computer display or using a screen
                reader and answering questions.  This condition has 7 trials. In this condition, you will only need to
                answer to the study administrator a number between 0 and 100
                of what the proportion of the smaller encoding is to the larger one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a single trial across all three conditions, you will compare a pair of values encoded in visual, tactile,
            tabular form. Upon comparing the patterns, you will <b>orally </b>answer to the researcher:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>which one (left or right) in the pair is of
                        the
                        <b style="color: red;">smaller quantity</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    </b> Then, you will answer again and <b>provide a number
                        between 0 and 100 to indicate the
                        <b style="color:red;">proportion</b></b> of the smaller element (from your previous answer) to
                    the
                    larger one.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Note that since both
            “visual” and “tabular” parts will be conducted using a computer, you will complete these two parts
            <b>together
                on a computer in random order</b>. You will perform the “tactile” part of our study separately on paper
            while
            blind-folded.

            For trials that were completed using both computer and embossed paper, we organized them into blocks of 7
            trials. In visual conditions, each trial will be displayed on a separate webpage. After every 7 trials, you
            will encounter a "page break," which allows you to choose whether to continue or not. Similarly, in tactile
            conditions, we will pause after every 7 trials.

        </p>

        <h2> Encoding Types</h2>
        <p>
            In our study, we encoded numerical value pairs using various visual/tactile elements. The below sections
            will explain how values are <b>encoded and represented</b> in these encodings.
            Note that "visual" and "tactile" present same types of encodings on different mediums. It is important for
            you to understand the relationship between numerical value and encoding types.
        </p>

        <h3>Lines</h3>
        <p>In encoding type “lines”, numerical values are represented in lengths. You will inspect the pair of lines
            directly by comparing their difference in <b>lengths</b>. An example of a pair of two lines encodings: </p>
        <div class="example-svg">
            <svg baseProfile="full" height="6cm" version="1.1" width="12cm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                <defs />
                <line stroke="black" stroke-width="4" transform="rotate(41,112.80000000000001,112.80000000000001)"
                    x1="3cm" x2="3cm" y1="2.25cm" y2="3.75cm" />
                <line stroke="black" stroke-width="4" transform="rotate(-26,338.40000000000003,112.80000000000001)"
                    x1="9cm" x2="9cm" y1="1.5cm" y2="4.5cm" /><text x="218.08" y="218.08">A</text><text
                    x="443.68000000000006" y="218.08">B</text></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this example, “Line A” is shorter than “Line B” in length, thus it is the smaller element in the pair.
            “Line A” is 50% in length of “Line B”.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Areas</h3>
        <p>
            In encoding type "areas", numerical values are represented in areas in circles. The area of a circle is the
            measure of <b>the amount of space enclosed by the circle</b>. You will inspect the pair of
            circles
            and compare their difference in areas. An example of a pair of two area encodings:
        </p>
        <div class="example-svg">
            <svg baseProfile="full" height="6cm" version="1.1" width="12cm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                <defs />
                <pattern height="10" id="pattern" patternTransform="rotate(45 0 0)" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse"
                    width="10">
                    <line stroke="black" stroke-width="3" x1="0" x2="0" y1="0" y2="10" />
                </pattern>
                <circle cx="9cm" cy="3cm" fill="url(#pattern)" r="1.5cm" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
                <circle cx="3cm" cy="3cm" fill="url(#pattern)" r="1.9364916731037083cm" stroke="black"
                    stroke-width="2" /><text x="218.08" y="218.08">A</text><text x="443.68000000000006"
                    y="218.08">B</text>
            </svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this example, "Area B" is smaller in its enclosed region than "Area A", thus it is the smaller element in
            the pair.
            "Area B" is 50% of "Area A" in area.
        </p>
        <hr>


        <h3>Curves</h3>
        <p>
            In encoding type "curves", numerical values are represented in the value of <b>curvature</b>. Curvature is a
            measure of <b>how much a curve deviates from being a stright line</b>. You will inspect the pair of curves
            and
            compare their difference in the value of curvature. An example of a pair of two curve encodings: </p>
        <div class="example-svg">
            <svg baseProfile="full" height="6cm" version="1.1" width="12cm" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                <defs /><text x="218.08" y="218.08">A</text><text x="443.68000000000006" y="218.08">B</text>
                <path
                    d="M 56.400000000000006,112.80000000000001 C 112.80000000000001,78.96000000000001 112.80000000000001,78.96000000000001 169.20000000000002,112.80000000000001"
                    fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="3"
                    transform="rotate(78,112.80000000000001,112.80000000000001)" />
                <path
                    d="M 282.0,112.80000000000001 C 338.4,45.120000000000005 338.4,45.120000000000005 394.8,112.80000000000001"
                    fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="3"
                    transform="rotate(49,338.40000000000003,112.80000000000001)" /></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this example, "Curve A" is smaller than "Curve B" in the value of curvature. "Curve A" is 50% of "Curve
            B" in the value of curvature.
